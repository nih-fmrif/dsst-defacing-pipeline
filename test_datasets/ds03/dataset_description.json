    "Acknowledgements": "We are forever grateful to the twins and their families for their willingness to participate in our studies. We thank Liza van Eijk, Victoria O'Callaghan, Islay Davies, Ethan Campi, Kimberley Huang, Eleanor Roga, Michael Day, Aiman Al-Najjar, Zoie Nott, Tom Shaw, Nicole Atcheson, and Sarah Daniel for data acquisition. We thank Naomi Wray for funding the collection of metabolic samples, including detailed dietary data, Ian Hickie and Kathleen Merikangas for funding and support of actigraphy data, and Sarah Medland and ENIGMA GWAS for funding genotyping. Special thanks to Anjali Henders, Leanne Wallace, Lorelle Nunn and the many laboratory assistants at the Human Studies Unit (part of the Program in Complex Trait Genomics based at the Institute of Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland) for the processing and storage of biological samples. Thanks also to Julie Henry for helpful discussion of social cognition measures. The QTAB project was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Australia (Project Grant ID: 1078756 to MJW), the Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland, and with the assistance of resources from the Centre for Advanced Imaging and the Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation, University of Queensland. We acknowledge the Queensland Twin Registry (QTwin) (https://www.qimrberghofer.edu.au/study/queensland-twin-registry-study) for generously sharing database information for recruitment. Recruitment was further facilitated through access to Twins Research Australia, a national resource supported by a Centre of Research Excellence Grant (ID: 1079102) from the NHMRC. Lastly, we thank the many researchers worldwide for providing access to their assessments.",
